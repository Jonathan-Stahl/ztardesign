          <p>
            The final design is a powerful and colourful design. It
utilises popping colours that match Australia’s landscape
and emerges white highlights that are sleek and legible.
Not only does all the colours represent Australia’s landscape
beauty, they represent key things. The bright red and orange
colours represent Australia’s rich resources in its land,
the soft greens represent green solutions and sustainable
futures, and the blues represent nuclear power in relation
to boiling water for energy.</p>
          </p>
          <p>Its abstract layout, including asymmetrical and symmetrical
            features, extends across the whole car, showcasing large
            themes that are versatile, just like nuclear power, an
            incredibly versatile tool for shaping the future. Numerous text
            displays are everywhere on this car, though not smothering
            it. The text effortlessly reads words and phrases that
            attribute nuclear power positively, encouraging those who
            read it to feel convicted or inspired. White texts, as well as
            patterns, have been chosen to represent purity, cleanliness,
            and beginnings.</p>
          <p>The detail and thought going into this design has been
            well tested and well thought through. From the specific
            shade of colours chosen, and the words and phrases
            to communicate a message, all the way to the shapes,
            logos, and typography developed, and the maintenance of
            a consistent, seemless, and enveloping design.</p>
