          <h1>24hr Design Competition Winning Entry</h1>
          <p>This 30-second animation was developed in Blender for the entry into the '<i>Screen Media</i>' category for the University of Canberra's annual <a href="https://itch.io/jam/24hr-digital-design-challenge-2024">24hr Digital Design Challenge (2024)</a>. The 24hr Digital Design Challenge is an intense event where students create a fully realised project within a single 24hr period. With a given prompt, "<i>Together We Thrive,</i>" participants are encouraged to think creatively, take risks, and develop innovative concepts. This challenge demands efficient work, strategic decisions, and effective time management, providing a platform to push boundaries and unlock untapped potential.</p>

          <p>This animation portrays a jigsaw puzzle coming to life, symbolising the power of connection and community. It begins with a few dull pieces that transform and come alive as they connect, gradually forming a vibrant and complex whole, with each puzzle piece having its own unique personality. The theme, "<i>Together We Thrive</i>," is central to the design and reflected in every detail.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><b>Symbolic Connections:</b> The joining of puzzle pieces represents individuals coming together. Each piece contributes to a unified, impactful result, emphasising the strength of collaboration.</li>
            <li><b>Unique Characters:</b> Every puzzle piece has a distinct personality, symbolising the diversity of our communities and how individuality can enhance collective success.</li>    
            <li><b>Colour Transformation:</b> Dull pieces transform into bright pastel colours as they connect, signifying the revival and growth that stems from unity and mutual support.</li>
            <li><b>Narrative Detail:</b> A single piece refuses to join the puzzle, challenging the community's ability to thrive. However, another piece voluntarily splits to complete the puzzle, illustrating sacrifice, adaptability, and the importance of every member’s contribution.</li>    
          </ul>

          <p>This animation encapsulates the message that a thriving community is built on connection, diversity, and collective effort. Together we thrive, altogether the jigsaw puzzle thrives.</p>
