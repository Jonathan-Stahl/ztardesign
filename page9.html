          <h1>Synthic: An Original Typeface</h1>
          <p>
            Synthic is a that is set apart and
versatile. It has been adapted to be functional for use as both a body
copy and display font. Synthic’s notable design uses geometrical shape
sits in every letter, symbol and number, mostly done through mathematical
and visual measurements to maintain its perfection. The typeface is tidy
and consistent all round, being aesthetically pleasing to look at and
comfortable to read. It excels at being a modern and futuristic typeface
that also involves some traditional typeface design aspects like the weight
contrasts in Times New Roman. Overall, Synthic is a unique, future
inspired and compelling type-face.</p>
