          <h2>Movie Scene Soundtrack</h2>

The voice actors for this scene are Saskia Day playing as Jinx, Gloria Stahl playing as Vi, and Sana Chatley playing as Caitlyn. The scene focuses on two sisters, Jinx and Vi, reuniting after years of separation, enhancing the emotional state the characters feel through the development of the composition.
